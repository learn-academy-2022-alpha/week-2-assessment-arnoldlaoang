# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer:
  - The difference is that parameters are the values listed inside the variable of a given function and the arguements are the injected values into the function's input.

  Researched answer:
  - Through my research I learned that the difference between a parameter and an arguement is their own individual values they both represent when interacting within the function. The parameter is the representation of values that defines a function that is malleable for processing after interacting with the arguement and the arguement is the expression that interacts with a new "real" values that will be injected inside the parameter values.


2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer:
  - The predefined parameters taken from the built in method .map() by JavaScript are the parameters of index, arrays and values and all of them are optional except the values. 

  Researched answer:
  - I learned through my research that indeed in JavaScript the .map() function takes in index, arrays and values as predefined parameters and it is true that the only required parameter is value and the optional parameters are both index and the array.


3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer:
  - The difference between both functions is that .map() function deals with an array by iterating whereas .filter() function deals with an array by looping but they both return a new array but with their own respective met conditions being higher-order functions.

  Researched answer:
  - Through my research I learned that the difference between map and filter is that they both have their own specific way to deal with an array, they are utilized for their own specific conditions to properly process the given specific tasks needing to be resolved. Although both .map() and .filter() function both gives back a new array, according to the Syllabus ".map() function iterates through an array and returns a new array of the same length whereas .filter() function in comparison returns a new array with only the values that are truthy or the values that satisfy your stated condition are return a subset of the given array." The two higher-order functions have their specific characteristics, the .map() function make the function reusable by taking/interacting with all items in an array, and in contrast the .filter() is a function that makes decisions on each item in an array returning a subset based on given conditions.


4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer:
  - The difference between a function and a method is that a function is a bunch of codes that you call on by it's name and method is a bunch of codes you call on my a name that's linked an object that contains a list of keys with values.

  Researched answer:
  - Through my research I learned that the main difference between a function and a method is that a function is being called solely by it's name and that method is being called by a name that coorelates to an object. Although they both in fact are pieces of codes that's being called by name, they do differ by the fact that method takes it steps forward to call in more informations stored through keys and values unlike function being straight forward called by itself. Function may use the return value to be able to return data, it can also operate on passed data like parameters and Method is capable in working on implied contained data with it's objects keys and values.

5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer:
  - Object destructuring is a way you call out multiple values in one "swoop" statement producing an output.

  Researched answer:
  - Through my research I learned that object destructuring is just an alternative way of processing datas instead of console.log'ging each individual output into one expression but also giving in their own individual variables that's accessable to be recalled independently.


6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer:
  - In JavaScript hoisting is when you do the opposite of the orthadox way of initializing the variable's value first then after declaring the function, instead we firstly declare the function then we start the intialization of the value within the variable.

  Researched answer:
  - Through my reearch i learned that hoisting in JavaScript is a way when its okay to utilize a function, classes or variables to the top of the scope before code execution prior the initializion then after using the declaration as they would conventionally at first, but so instead doing it the other way around where we first declare functions then intialize after in retrospect.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance:
  - Class Inheritance permits you to define a class and take all of the practicality such as methods and properties of another class. 

2. React:
  - React is a JavaScript library for building complex user interfaces that gives the capabilty to make recyclable components.

3. React state:
  - Rect state is a function that is a plain JavaScript object built to symbolize the component informaions of it's current whereabouts.

4. React lifecycle methods:
  - React lifecycle methods goes as follow: Mounting as the birth, Update as the growth, and Unmount as the death which all relates with your component.

5. DOM:
  - DOM is an acronym for Document Object Model, it's a representation as a tree data structure.
